# 📉 Customer Retention & Churn Analytics — Power BI + SQL Project

An end-to-end **Customer Analytics** project using **SQL, Power BI, Power Query, and DAX** to measure retention, churn, repeat customers, customer lifetime value patterns, and overall customer behavior.

This project demonstrates complete workflow skills:  
data cleaning → SQL analysis → data modeling → DAX → dashboard design → churn insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer retention is critical for growth.  
This project analyzes:

- Which customers are active vs churned  
- Repeat purchase behavior  
- Average spend patterns  
- Customer lifetime behavior  
- Regional churn distribution  
- High-risk customer segments  

The dashboard highlights churn drivers and retention opportunities.

## 🧩 Business Problem

Companies lack clear visibility into:

- Why customers leave (churn)  
- Spend pattern differences between retained vs churned users  
- Repeat order behavior  
- Region-wise churn  
- Customer lifetime value patterns  

This dashboard solves those gaps with interactive insights.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Identify **active vs churned customers**  
- Calculate **repeat rate & retention rate**  
- Measure **average spend & average orders**  
- Analyze churn by **region**, **segment**, and **order frequency**  
- Create a **Customer Status Model** using SQL & DAX

## 🛠 SQL Queries Used

```sql
-- 1. Active customers (purchased in last 90 days)
SELECT customer_id, last_purchase_date
FROM customer_data
WHERE DATEDIFF(day, last_purchase_date, '2024-01-01') <= 90;

-- 2. Churned customers (inactive > 90 days)
SELECT customer_id, last_purchase_date
FROM customer_data
WHERE DATEDIFF(day, last_purchase_date, '2024-01-01') > 90;

-- 3. Repeat customers
SELECT customer_id
FROM customer_data
WHERE total_orders > 1;

-- 4. Average orders per customer
SELECT AVG(total_orders) AS avg_orders
FROM customer_data;

-- 5. Average spend per customer
SELECT AVG(total_spent) AS avg_spend
FROM customer_data;

-- 6. Region-level churn distribution
SELECT region,
       SUM(CASE WHEN churn_flag = 1 THEN 1 END) AS churned,
       SUM(CASE WHEN churn_flag = 0 THEN 1 END) AS active
FROM customer_data
GROUP BY region;
```

---

## 🧮 DAX Measures

```
Active Customers =
CALCULATE(COUNT(customer_data[customer_id]), customer_data[churn_flag] = 0)

Churned Customers =
CALCULATE(COUNT(customer_data[customer_id]), customer_data[churn_flag] = 1)

Repeat Customers =
CALCULATE(COUNT(customer_data[customer_id]), customer_data[total_orders] > 1)

Repeat Rate % =
DIVIDE([Repeat Customers], [Active Customers], 0)

Avg Orders =
AVERAGE(customer_data[total_orders])

Avg Spend =
AVERAGE(customer_data[total_spent])
```
